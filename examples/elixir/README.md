# WasmExample

Example project how to run the wasm component generated by Betty Blocks actions builder.

## Quickstart

Place your app.wasm in the root or change the filepath in `lib/wasm_example/application.ex`.

```sh
mix deps.get
# afterwards you can run:
# the first argument is you application id
# the second argument is the action id
# the third argument is the input for the action
mix run -e "WasmExample.call_action(\"842f0d3e8c3844d8b20e1447d79c7d27\", \"e6a39373a8c840c88a4a530cf7da6370\", %{}) |> IO.inspect"
```

## Layout

This example elixir project uses [Wasmex](https://github.com/tessi/wasmex) to call the betty blocks wasm component.

In the file `lib/wasm_example/application.ex` Wasmex will start the component under the application supervisor with the name `:wasm_example`. In the `lib/wasm_example.ex` file the component is called with the function call_action. This uses Wasmex component named `:wasm_example`.

If you want to use this in your own project, copy the child from the supervisor and rename the name to something that makes more sense in your project. Check the Wasmex docs for more info.
